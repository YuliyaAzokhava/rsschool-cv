## About me:
I am a junior front end developer. Independent start and fast learner. I like to constantly improve and learn something new. I like to create something useful and beautiful for other people.
What I love most about being a front-end developer is that when you write code, you can immediately see its result in the browser, it inspires and fascinates me.
